initramfs-tools (0.10) breezy; urgency=low

  The "I can see you!" release.

  * Unconditionally require busybox.  Might revert this eventually
    but it's too much of a pain right now do this without
    a reasonably environment

  * Use modprobe to load modules

  * Iterate through /sys/bus/pci and /sys/bus/usb and load drivers
    based on their modalias

  * Start to use /sbin for things

  * Include depmod in the image.  Use it at boot time.

  * Edit config example to show the modules that do need to be included
    manually for this build.

initramfs-tools (0.8) breezy; urgency=low

  The "We are one in the spirit..." release

  * Export the command line variables so that the various scripts
    can see them.

initramfs-tools (0.7) breezy; urgency=low

  The "CONFORM!" release.

  * Make command line arguments almost match mkinitrd.  The -m argument
    doesn't make any sense, so it's not supported.  Add support for
    overriding the confdir, and specifying version no longer expects -v.

  * Add sed and grep to the initramfs for now.  Will prune these
    eventually, but for now mdrun needs them.

  * Add mdadm and mdrun to the initramfs.

  * Add hookscript directories.

  * Call hookscripts

  Thanks to David Weinhall <tao@acc.umu.se> for the dependancy-based
  hookscripts.

  The "Sweep! ....  Off!" release.

  * Add commandline parameters for NFSROOT and BOOT.

  * Moving loading of boot functions to after commandline parsing.

  * Allow NFSROOT variable to be set to auto to pick up value from DHCP
    Server.

  * /etc/mkinitramfs/modules should not be a conffile.

  * Support busybox.

  * Fix bug where -k would delete the tmp files, and otherwise it would keep
    them.

  * Handle # for comments in the modules file.

  * arch:all, not arch:any
