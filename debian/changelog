initramfs-tools (0.9) breezy; urgency=low

  * Unconditionally require busybox.  Might revert this eventually
    but it's too much of a pain right now do this without
    a reasonably environment.

initramfs-tools (0.8) breezy; urgency=low

  The "We are one in the spirit..." release

    can see them.

initramfs-tools (0.7) breezy; urgency=low

  The "CONFORM!" release.

  * Make command line arguments almost match mkinitrd.  The -m argument
    doesn't make any sense, so it's not supported.  Add support for
    overriding the confdir, and specifying version no longer expects -v.

  * Add sed and grep to the initramfs for now.  Will prune these
    eventually, but for now mdrun needs them.

  * Add mdadm and mdrun to the initramfs.

  * Add hookscript directories.

  * Call hookscripts

  Thanks to David Weinhall <tao@acc.umu.se> for the dependancy-based
  hookscripts.

    Server.
